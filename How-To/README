This document contains some instructions on how to compile CM12.1 for the YP-G1

- First ensure that you're on the right branch (cm-12.1 for the device tree and cm-12.0 for the kernel source)

- Be sure to have the proprietary vendor binaries (cm-11.0)

- Download the hardware/samsung repo from omni. To do so, in the hardware folder inside your CM tree 
 do the following: git clone https://github.com/omnirom/android_hardware_samsung -b android-5.0 samsung

- The sub-folders here contain patches that are needed in order to get CM12 working. Their names represents the
actual project where they needed to be applied. You can either execute the "apply_patches.sh" script or copy them
individually and use the git am command to apply them.

Once you're done, you can go ahead and do the command to build CM12
. build/envsetup.sh && brunch ypg1
